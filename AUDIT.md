## Manual review

Reviewed state reachability, replay prevention, role checks, input bounds, model-output normalization, validator independence, prompt-injection boundaries, evidence authority, privacy, source freshness, fund custody, and certification claims.

## Findings and residual risk

No known high-, medium-, or submission-blocking defect remains. It does not verify purchases, identities, product facts, defamation claims, or the truth of a review. Validator disagreement can leave a transaction unresolved, and third-party review is discretionary; this audit cannot guarantee acceptance.

The concrete runner pin matches the runner documented for GenLayer contract examples. The linter's newer-runner notice is informational; the pinned source passed live StudioNet.
